<p>The first tests I wrote were with PyUnit, I don&#39;t remember what the project was, I just remember that it was horribly implemented, I didn&#39;t have any notion of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design">SOLID</a>) principles, so it was very difficult to write the tests and eventually I gave it up.</p>
<p>A couple of years later I started to develop a large enterprise application in .NET which forced me to improve my software architecture skills, I started reading a lot of books on the subject:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Enterprise-Application-Architecture-Martin/dp/0321127420/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1342270683&amp;sr=8-1">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a> by Martin Fowler</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Principles-Patterns-Practices-C/dp/0131857258/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1342270847&amp;sr=1-4">Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#</a> by Robert C. Martin and Micah Martin</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-NET-Components-Juval-Lowy/dp/0596102070/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1342270952&amp;sr=1-1">Programming .NET Components, 2nd Edition</a> by Juval Lowy</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft%C2%AE-NET-Architecting-Applications-Pro-Developer/dp/073562609X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1342275329&amp;sr=8-1">Architecting Applications for the Enterprise</a> by Dino Esposito and Andrea Saltarello</li>
</ul>
<p>As I was reading the books I began to realize how little I understand about software craftsmanship and how much more there is to learn.</p>
<p>So I started writing tests again (still after the code itself), I could see the value of the tests, since it helped the stability of the application I was working on (to this day there aren&#39;t any new bugs).</p>
<p>But the tests still didn&#39;t feel right, they didn&#39;t cover all of the scenarios, they were annoying to write, I kept having to change the original after adding the tests.</p>
<p>Later on I wrote a <a href="http://todotxt.com">todo.txt</a> desktop editor in Python and QT, I looked for a testing framework and found <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/doctest.html">doctest</a> which allows you to write the tests inside the code (or in simple text files), like this:</p>
<pre><code>  def add(x, y):      &quot;&quot;&quot;      &gt;&gt;&gt; add(0, 0)      0      &gt;&gt;&gt; add(0, 1)      1      &gt;&gt;&gt; add(1, 0)      1      &gt;&gt;&gt; add(1, 1)      2      &quot;&quot;&quot;      return x+y
</code></pre><p>As you can see the docstring includes 4 tests (0+0, 0+1, 1+0 and 1+1).</p>
<p>This was my first attempt at TDD, it wasn&#39;t perfect, some tests were written before and some were written after the implementation, but I could feel I was starting to get it (you can see the git code in <a href="https://bitbucket.org/3david/qtodotxt">bitbucket</a>).</p>
<p>A few years ago I started getting into Ruby on Rails, and the smartest thing I did was subscribe to <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts">Gary Bernhardt&#39;s Destroy All Software screencasts</a>, most of what I know now about TDD I learned from these screencasts (so thank you Gary!).</p>
<p>I discovered an amazing testing framework called <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> where you write your test in a much more readable format:</p>
<pre><code>describe Cat do  describe &quot;#talk&quot; do    it &quot;returns &#39;Meow&#39;&quot; do      cat = Cat.new      cat.talk.should == &#39;Meow&#39;    end    it &quot;returns &#39;Prrr&#39; after eating&quot; do      cat = Cat.new      cat.eat      cat.talk.should == &#39;Prrr&#39;    end  endend
</code></pre><p>When you run the tests this is the output:</p>
<pre><code>Cat  #talk    returns &#39;Meow&#39;    returns &#39;Prrr&#39; after eating
</code></pre><p>The hierarchy and the plain text for examples and contexts make the output perfect as documentation for the code.</p>
<p>I learned that there are several kinds of tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unit tests: test methods or classes in isolation, all external dependencies are stubbed (if a test fails you will usually find the error in a very narrow area of code).</li>
<li>Integration tests: test the integration between several methods or classes, some of the external dependencies can be stubbed (if a test fails its harder to find the error).</li>
<li>Acceptance tests: test the system as a whole, without any stubs. For example, open the web application in a browser and check that certain elements exist, or execute a command line application and check that the output matches what was expected.</li>
</ul>
<p>I developed various Rails applications, and with each application my technique and my understanding of TDD improved, I could feel I was making progress. Back then I only wrote unit and integration tests.</p>
<p>I also started using a javascript testing framework called <a href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/">Jasmine</a> which is basically RSpec for javascript.</p>
<p>At first, I was progressing slowly, working with TDD was much slower than non-TDD because I kept getting stuck on tests I wasn&#39;t sure how to write. But after a few months watching lots of screencasts, reading tons of blog posts on TDD, and spending a lot of time trying to improve my code and my tests I got to a stage where I&#39;m working faster with TDD than without.</p>
<p>Whenever I write code without writing the test first, it just feels wrong and sloppy, and I can&#39;t make excuses anymore, since it doesn&#39;t take more time.</p>
<p>About a month ago I read <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/achbd/the-rspec-book">The RSpec Book</a> and it filled all of the holes, finally I had a full understanding of an entire BDD process that felt right to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write the user stories</li>
<li>Select the user stories for the current iteration</li>
<li>Write a cucumber feature for each story (with all of the required scenarios, I find it best to write the scenarios with a QA person or a product owner).</li>
<li>Now start making the scenarios pass using ordinary TDD (write the actual code with unit and integration tests first).</li>
<li>When all of the scenarios of a feature are passing, it basically means the feature is complete (now you need to do some exploratory testing to see if it really works).</li>
</ul>
<p>As I understand it there are two ways to use Cucumber:</p>
<ul>
<li>QA tool - writing super-specific tests (using the <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-rails/issues/174">&quot;evil&quot; websteps</a>, I click this, I enter that, I see this...), this way your feature files get huge and you can no longer use it for documentation because it&#39;s too long and no one will read it.</li>
<li>BDD tool - write the acceptance tests from the stories in an abstract way, so the feature files are easier to scan and understand.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know a lot of people don&#39;t like using Cucumber, and at first I thought so too, but after reading the RSpec book and trying it out I think that as long as you&#39;re using it as a BDD tool it can actually be more comfortable then rspec (for acceptance tests), I like the the <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/blob/master/examples/i18n/en/features/addition.feature">Scenario Examples</a> feature allows to you to tests multiple inputs in a pretty clean way:</p>
<pre><code>Scenario Outline: Add two numbers  Given I have entered &lt;input_1&gt; into the calculator  And I have entered &lt;input_2&gt; into the calculator  When I press &lt;button&gt;  Then the result should be &lt;output&gt; on the screenExamples:  | input_1 | input_2 | button | output |  | 20      | 30      | add    | 50     |  | 2       | 5       | add    | 7      |  | 0       | 40      | add    | 40     |
</code></pre><p>The cucumber tests filled the gap between the user stories and the integration/unit tests for me and they help me stay much focused and a have a better indication of &quot;done&quot;.</p>
<p>To sum things up, the three things I like most about this process:</p>
<ul>
<li>My code is a lot more stable.</li>
<li>Helps me focus.</li>
<li>I&#39;m discovering my code instead of guessing it into existence.</li>
</ul>
