<ul>
<li>Syntax errors - missing semicolons/parenthesis, bad jQuery/css selectors.</li>
<li>Not enough knowledge about the problem domain or the technology.</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple of days ago I was helping a good friend with a coding problem and he told me: &quot;Don&#39;t solve it, tell me the strategy to solve it&quot;, this was the first time anyone told me that and it got me thinking... he was right, by solving every problem I&#39;m not allowing the young programmers to learn and that gave me the idea to write this post.</p>
<p>I tried to think of the ways I deal with coding problems and I came up with several principles.</p>
<h2 id="1-always-write-syntactically-clean-code">1. Always write syntactically-clean code</h2>
<p>I often see people writing code with no coding standard (inconsistent indentation, spacing, etc...), and when I criticize them about it they say &quot;I&#39;m just testing something, it&#39;s not production code, bla bla bla...&quot;.</p>
<p>And when they ask me to help and I take a quick look at the code and tell them they&#39;re missing a semicolon or something like that they&#39;re amazed at how I do it.</p>
<p>Well... there&#39;s no magic to it, I&#39;m just always writing my code as clean as possible (perfectly indented, consistent spacing between functions and parenthesis, etc... all according to a coding standard for the language I&#39;m currently using).</p>
<p>Once you get used to always writing and looking at clean and consistent code, then whenever something is out of place, it just pops out.</p>
<h2 id="2-don-t-write-large-pieces-of-code-without-seeing-if-it-works">2. Don&#39;t write large pieces of code without seeing if it works</h2>
<p>(In a positive form: &quot;Write code in small iterations of write-test-write-test...&quot;).</p>
<p>I&#39;m constantly seeing people creating a new project and writing a lot of code without even compiling and running. The first time they try to actually run it they have no idea what&#39;s not working and have to go over a lot of code until they figure out what&#39;s wrong.</p>
<p>If you do have to figure out how to fix a large piece of code, the best way is to split the code to small chunks and check if they&#39;re working. Let&#39;s look at an example: People sometimes come to me with code like this (it happens a lot lately, I&#39;m not sure why...):</p>
<pre>
  $('div.class1 a[href^=https://]')
    .doSomething()
    .doSomethingElse()...
</pre>

<p>To debug this you should use your browser&#39;s developer tools (FireBug, Chrome Developer Tools, ...). I personally prefer running test code directly in the JS console or adding console.log() calls as opposed to adding breakpoints (I don&#39;t yet trust JavaScript debuggers):</p>
<ul>
<li>First, check the jQuery selector (in the browser&#39;s JS console), see if it returns the correct elements.</li>
<li>If it doesn&#39;t, you found your bug (or one of them :-))</li>
<li>if it does work, move on to &quot;doSomething()&quot;, again, test it in the browser&#39;s JS console using the result of the selector</li>
<li>and so on...</li>
</ul>
<p>The best habit for this is to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development">BDD</a> which will force you to write smaller chunks of code in every iteration.</p>
<h2 id="3-solve-the-bug-not-the-symptom">3. Solve the bug, not the symptom</h2>
<p>I often see young programmers try to solve bugs by treating the specific symptoms described in a bug report instead of trying to understand why that bug is happening and what is causing it.</p>
<p>Make sure you understand the domain of the problem and the technologies used in the feature, because if you don&#39;t, you&#39;ll just cause more harm than good.</p>
<p>I hope you find this useful,
Until the next time,
David.</p>
