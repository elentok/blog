<p>Why? for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hibernation was way too slow, over one minute to hibernate is way too much, with XP it&#39;s about 30 seconds. And usually when I need to hibernate, it has to be done as fast as possible.</li>
<li>Sleep was also very slow, about 15 seconds compared to XP&#39;s 5~10 seconds.</li>
<li>Performance in power-save mode is quite slow (One time on XP when I plugged it in, for some reason it didn&#39;t switch to high-performance mode and I didn&#39;t notice until I opened System Properties and saw the CPU speed was 800MHz...).</li>
<li>I&#39;m tired of constantly tweaking and disabling parts of Vista that cause lots of HD grinding. I don&#39;t want my computer to do things without me telling it to.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, I&#39;m now back on my good old XP, and maybe when KDE 4.1 comes out I&#39;ll give Ubuntu another try.</p>
