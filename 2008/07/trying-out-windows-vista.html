It kept throwing &quot;Unhandled win32 exception&quot;, and after several hours of trying to fix it, I gave up and decided to reinstall.</p>
<p>On the way home I thought about maybe trying to install Vista (I got a Vista Business CD with the laptop), I heard all sorts of opinions about it and I decided to test it for myself (I tried it about a year ago on my old computer with only 1GB RAM, and I removed it after a week...).</p>
<p>The installation was very fast, about 20 minutes, drivers were easy to install (Dell&#39;s semi-automatic drivers cd is a brilliant idea).</p>
<p>I&#39;m currently using Aero with &quot;animate windows when minimizing and maximizing&quot; disabled and it&#39;s very fast.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t really installed much yet, so this is far from a true performance review, I&#39;ll probably know better in a couple of days.</p>
<p>The one thing I had a problem with is copying large file through network which kept hanging, but I found <a href="http://www.winxpcentral.com/forums/showthread.php?p=45494">this forum thread</a> that solved it by doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open &quot;Command Prompt&quot; as administrator</li>
<li>Run:
<strong>netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=disabled</strong></li>
<li>You should see an &quot;Ok.&quot;</li>
<li>Restart and open &quot;Command Prompt&quot; as administrator again.</li>
<li>Run:
<strong>netsh int tcp show global</strong></li>
<li>One of the lines should be this:
<strong>Receive Window Auto-Tuning Level    : disabled</strong></li>
</ul>
