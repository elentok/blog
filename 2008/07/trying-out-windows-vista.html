WampServer package), I tried reinstalling it, I tried several other versions,
nothing seemed to work. It kept throwing &quot;Unhandled win32 exception&quot;, and after
several hours of trying to fix it, I gave up and decided to reinstall.</p>
<p>On the way home I thought about maybe trying to install Vista (I got a Vista
Business CD with the laptop), I heard all sorts of opinions about it and I
decided to test it for myself (I tried it about a year ago on my old computer
with only 1GB RAM, and I removed it after a week...).</p>
<p>The installation was very fast, about 20 minutes, drivers were easy to install
(Dell&#39;s semi-automatic drivers cd is a brilliant idea).</p>
<p>I&#39;m currently using Aero with &quot;animate windows when minimizing and maximizing&quot;
disabled and it&#39;s very fast.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t really installed much yet, so this is far from a true performance
review, I&#39;ll probably know better in a couple of days.</p>
<p>The one thing I had a problem with is copying large file through network which
kept hanging, but I found
<a href="http://www.winxpcentral.com/forums/showthread.php?p=45494">this forum thread</a>
that solved it by doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open &quot;Command Prompt&quot; as administrator</li>
<li>Run: <code>netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=disabled</code></li>
<li>You should see an &quot;Ok.&quot;</li>
<li>Restart and open &quot;Command Prompt&quot; as administrator again.</li>
<li>Run: <code>netsh int tcp show global</code></li>
<li>One of the lines should be this: <code>Receive Window Auto-Tuning Level : disabled</code></li>
</ul>
