called &quot;Little Mui-Ne Cottages&quot;, it&#39;s very nice here, it sits directly on the
beach and we have ocean view from our room.</p>
<p>I&#39;m writing this post on the hotel&#39;s Dell Inspiron 700m, it&#39;s a 12.1&quot; laptop,
it&#39;s cute but a little too small, and the reflective screen is one of the most
annoying things I have ever worked with, it does look quite sharp, but it&#39;s hard
to see anything with all of the reflections from the sun (I&#39;m under a roof, but
there&#39;s sun coming in from the outside).</p>
<p>This experience has made more sure that the choice of Dell D630 is the right
one. (also, the keyboard is a little too small, but maybe it&#39;s the vietnamese
characters on the keyboard that are confusing me...).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also had a chance to play a little with ACDSee 10 Photo Manager and it&#39;s
really comfortable (I used it to resize&amp;rotate the photos I uploaded).</p>
<p>Maybe later I&#39;ll upload some photos of the hotel and the view (I&#39;m tried from
uploading all of the photos of the previous post...).</p>
<p>Well, I&#39;m going to the pool... bye for now.</p>
