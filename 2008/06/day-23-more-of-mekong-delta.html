very nice people from all over the world (Australia, New-Zealand, Austria,
China, France, Germany, Holland, Spain, Japan), everyone was very friendly and
we had a great time. It was a great way of closing our trip.</p>
<p>This morning we went to see the floating market, it was quite different from
what I had imagined, I thought there would be lots of small boats full of fruit,
but instead there were lots of big boats selling all sort of stuff, and each
boat had a long bamboo pole on which they would stick the stuff they are selling
so people around will know what they are selling.</p>
<p>Here are some photos of the boats:</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a little boy who sailed near us (with his mother of course, I doubt if he
can sail by himself...) and tried to sell us some drinks:</p>

<p>There were some boats that matched what I had imagined:</p>

<p>Playing with the idea of Black&amp;White photography:</p>
<p><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_VWGZ0axfmrM/SF2gZLY73BI/AAAAAAAAAco/G2TUw5vT71g/s1600-h/DSCF3720.JPG"><img src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_VWGZ0axfmrM/SF2gZLY73BI/AAAAAAAAAco/G2TUw5vT71g/s320/DSCF3720.JPG" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Afterwards, we went to some village to see how they make noodles. At first they
make these giant pancake-like things (they&#39;re made out of rice, tapioca, and
maybe more stuff, I was tired and wasn&#39;t really paying attention...):</p>
<p><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_VWGZ0axfmrM/SF2gtQtt4tI/AAAAAAAAAcw/P7QTqja_ewE/s1600-h/DSCF3726.JPG"><img src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_VWGZ0axfmrM/SF2gtQtt4tI/AAAAAAAAAcw/P7QTqja_ewE/s320/DSCF3726.JPG" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And then they leave them to cool or dry or something (again, I wasn&#39;t really
listening...):</p>
<p><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_VWGZ0axfmrM/SF2gtrSFM9I/AAAAAAAAAc4/ztWUp3S3zXU/s1600-h/DSCF3727.JPG"><img src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_VWGZ0axfmrM/SF2gtrSFM9I/AAAAAAAAAc4/ztWUp3S3zXU/s320/DSCF3727.JPG" alt=""></a></p>
<p>In the same village we saw Pigzilla:</p>
<p><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_VWGZ0axfmrM/SF2gty_Y1MI/AAAAAAAAAdA/YOMTVrmh2T8/s1600-h/DSCF3729.JPG"><img src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_VWGZ0axfmrM/SF2gty_Y1MI/AAAAAAAAAdA/YOMTVrmh2T8/s320/DSCF3729.JPG" alt=""></a></p>
<p>This pig was enormous, but unfortunately this photo doesn&#39;t really show how big
it was (and I couldn&#39;t take another photo because she kept looking away).</p>
<p>From there we went to see Monkey Bridge (no idea why it&#39;s called Monkey Bridge):</p>
<p><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_VWGZ0axfmrM/SF2guRWU13I/AAAAAAAAAdI/mJ5GZBvFRLg/s1600-h/DSCF3733.JPG"><img src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_VWGZ0axfmrM/SF2guRWU13I/AAAAAAAAAdI/mJ5GZBvFRLg/s320/DSCF3733.JPG" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Well, this is the end of our trip, tomorrow we&#39;re flying back home, and I&#39;m
looking forward to it. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the trip was a lot of fun, but three
weeks is enough for me, I miss home, where everybody speaks my language, I miss
my family, my friends, I miss home food. I&#39;m tired of living out of my backpack.
I don&#39;t understand how people can take such long trips (four, six months and
higher), I&#39;d go nuts on such a long trip.</p>
<p>To sum things up, we had a lot of fun, we learned a lot (about Vietnam, about
the people, about ourselves), there were some not-so-fun stuff, but what I take
with me are the good memories (and the souvenirs...).</p>
<p>By the way, my estimation of 10000 photos is dead wrong, we reached somewhere
around 2000~3000 photos.</p>
