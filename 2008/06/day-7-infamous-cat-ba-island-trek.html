It was a really boring trek, for six hours I just looked at the rocks under me trying not fall. I am happy to say that I explored the jungles of Nam (long live Rambo!!) and survived, and it&#39;s nice to know that I can do it, but for the life of me, I can&#39;t figure out why some people find in treks? what&#39;s so much fun in swimming in your own sweat for hours on hours?</p>
<p>Oh, and the jungle was full of weird, creepy insects, and you have to be careful everywhere you touch not to get bitten by some creature (oh, there were also some snakes). There were tons of flying cockroach-like creatures called &quot;Sikada&quot; (don&#39;t know if I&#39;m spelling it right) that made noises that made the jungle sound like a very busy sawmill).</p>
<p>Once we were out of the jungle (which was one of the happiest moments of my life), we ate lunch in a local village and then went on a motorbike ride (both of us and a driver on one motorbike, heavy rain and slippery, curvey road... it was really cool and scary at the same time - motorbikes in Vietnam are considered family vehicles) to get to a boat that will take us back to the hotel.</p>
<p>We came back to the hotel tired and exhausted, took a shower, watched some movies on HBO (&quot;The Good Shepherd&quot; - good movie) and tried to dry the rest of the laundry.</p>
