over a mountain), it took us six hours (14km of rocky terrain), it was one of
the most horrible experiences of my life. It was a really boring trek, for six
hours I just looked at the rocks under me trying not fall. I am happy to say
that I explored the jungles of Nam (long live Rambo!!) and survived, and it&#39;s
nice to know that I can do it, but for the life of me, I can&#39;t figure out why
some people find in treks? what&#39;s so much fun in swimming in your own sweat for
hours on hours?</p>
<p>Oh, and the jungle was full of weird, creepy insects, and you have to be careful
everywhere you touch not to get bitten by some creature (oh, there were also
some snakes). There were tons of flying cockroach-like creatures called &quot;Sikada&quot;
(don&#39;t know if I&#39;m spelling it right) that made noises that made the jungle
sound like a very busy sawmill).</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Once we were out of the jungle (which was one of the happiest moments of my
life), we ate lunch in a local village and then went on a motorbike ride (both
of us and a driver on one motorbike, heavy rain and slippery, curvey road... it
was really cool and scary at the same time - motorbikes in Vietnam are
considered family vehicles) to get to a boat that will take us back to the
hotel.</p>
<p>We came back to the hotel tired and exhausted, took a shower, watched some
movies on HBO (&quot;The Good Shepherd&quot; - good movie) and tried to dry the rest of
the laundry.</p>
