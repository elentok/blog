clothes shop.</p>
<p>I bought a 100% silk tie for less than 3$ (I don&#39;t know what I&#39;ll do with a tie,
I don&#39;t even know how to put on a tie, but it comes in a cool box with cuff
lings...).</p>
<p>I also order a custom-made jacket for just 20$ (they measured me and
everything), it will be ready tomorrow (well since I&#39;m actually writing this
post on day 12, it will be ready today...).</p>
<p>Rotem ordered a custom-made silk dress for also 20$ (we went through like 20
shops until she found the exact color of fabric she wanted...).</p>
<p>It&#39;s a nice town, kinda hot, but there&#39;s enough shade.</p>
<p>We went for a swim in the hotel pool (haven&#39;t been in a pool for over 10
years...), it was fun.</p>
<p>Not much more to say, this is a shopping town, the people here live at their
stores (I mean that literally...).</p>
<p>The people here seem to get offended really quick when you bargain and offer a
price that is too low (some told us to go away...).</p>
