<p>This morning (instead of yesterday afternoon because it was way too hot) we went
on a tour of the city, we saw the Phuc Kien Assembly Hall (according to the
guide the Phuc Kien are a community of Chinese people who live in Vietnam), you
can the see in this photo:</p>

<p>Inside the hall there is a temple where the Phuc Kien people pray to several
gods, one of these gods is the Money God:</p>

<p>(There are many stores here were people have a small alters with a small Money
God figure and they pray to them).</p>
<p>Later on we went to see a 400 year-old Japanese bridge (according to the guide
the Japanese people were here before the Chinese people, and when the Chinese
came the Japanese build this gate to act as a dividing line between the Japanese
and Chinese parts of the city):</p>

<p>Not a very impressive bridge... (And why is it pink?)</p>
<p>The guide said they don&#39;t know exactly when it was built, but since there is a
statue of a dog in one end and statue of a monkey in the other end they think it
was started in the year of the monkey, and ended in the year of dog (maybe in
reverse, don&#39;t know much about the animal/year Japanese thing...).</p>
<p>Here you can see photos of the monkey and dog statues (try to guess which is
which :)... )</p>

<p>After the tour ended we went to pick us some clothes we had ordered, and went
back to the hotel. In a couple of hours we will be flying to Saigon.</p>
