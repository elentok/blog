<p>We reached the hotel at around 10am, fortunately we could check in immediately (and didn&#39;t have to wait until 2pm...) so we could get some sleep (hey, I woke up at 2am and couldn&#39;t sleep the entire flight! I needed some sleep...).</p>
<p>After a little rest we headed out of the hotel towards the old city.</p>
<p>This is my first visit to Europe and I have to say I&#39;m really impressed, first of all, public transportation here is brilliant, the Metro (sub-way) is very simple to understand, there are three lines: red, green and yellow that can get you to almost anywhere. And instead of buying ticket per station you buy a single ticket that can be &quot;activated&quot; for a predefined amount of time (75 minutes, 24 hours, 72 hours, 120 hours) and while this ticket is &quot;active&quot; (you &quot;activate&quot; the ticket in the train station) it can be used for the Metro, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tram">Tram</a> and buses.</p>
<p>Another amazing thing, it&#39;s so quiet and peaceful here, no car honking, no one yelling, cars stop to let you pass, when the first couple of cars stopped I was shocked!</p>
<p>And the buildings... the architecture is really beautiful, I haven&#39;t taken any photos (I was too messed up from the flight and from waking up early), tommorow I&#39;ll start taking some photos.</p>
