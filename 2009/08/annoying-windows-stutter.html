<p>Yesterday my laptop died on me (probably the <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13554_3-10020782-33.html">overheating nvidia chip problem</a>), and it will probably take some time until it fixed, so I took another shot at fixing the annoying stutter.</p>
<p>After googling more about the stutter I saw two forum posts about faulty wireless adapters that caused the system to stutter. I then remembered that in the last winter there was a really strong lightning one night that fried the built-in ethernet card on the computer (since then I&#39;ve been using a pci ethernet card), so I tried to disabling the built-in card in the device and the stutter stopped!!!</p>
