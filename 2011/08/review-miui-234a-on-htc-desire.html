Android 2.2), at first I was very impressed but as time went by I started
noticing a lot of annoyances:</p>
<ul>
<li>It required weekly reboots because it would get sluggish.</li>
<li>Hebrew support was less than standard, I needed to install a third-party
keyboard, Hebrew text was aligned to the left and numbers in Hebrew sentences
appeared backwards (&quot;123&quot; would appear as &quot;321&quot;).</li>
<li>I couldn&#39;t use the Waze navigation application while playing music because the
music would stutter.</li>
</ul>
<!--more-->
<p>I am very disappointed in google for releasing an operating system like this, I
am used to much higher quality from google products.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a programmer, I know it&#39;s nearly impossible to develop such a large
application that runs on a vast range of hardware with zero bugs, but since they
never release any updates, there&#39;s no hope for improvement. Unless you&#39;re
willing to lose your warranty and install a custom ROM you&#39;re stuck with what
you got.</p>
<p>Anyway, it took me about three months to snap and realize that I need to install
a custom ROM. I started with <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/">CyanogenMod</a> 7.0.3 (based on Android 2.3.3)
which was a big improvement, much faster, out-of-the-box Hebrew supports and
much more customizable.</p>
<p>After using CyanogenMod for a few weeks I started noticing some new annoyances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Due to a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=15311">memory leak in Android 2.3.3</a> I needed to reboot every two or
three days.</li>
<li>Spontaneous reboots (once a day or two).</li>
<li>Much faster than 2.2 but still gets sluggish after using it a day or two.</li>
<li>The camera&#39;s flash would turn on spontaneously (yeah, CyanogenMod is very
spontaneous...). </li>
<li>The data connections disconnected every hour or so, and then I needed to turn
it off and on for it two work again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Last week I installed <a href="http://miuiandroid.com/">MIUI 2.3.4a</a> and was very impressed (but since I got
burned before I decided to wait a week or two to see how it behaves in the long
run).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>So far I haven&#39;t had to reboot the device in over a week and it is still as fast
as when it first booted, and there were no spontaneous reboots.</p>
<p>MIUI 2.3.4a is based on Android 2.3.4:</p>

<p>The people behind MIUI made a lot of changes to the default Android UI, they
made it a little more iPhone-like.</p>
<p>For example, all of the applications are added the home screen by default (there
is no applications menu). Don&#39;t worry you can still use widgets:</p>

<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Qy2SZ799kFs/Tjv3w2flO8I/AAAAAAAABLE/E0k35azU4jU/s1600/home.png"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Qy2SZ799kFs/Tjv3w2flO8I/AAAAAAAABLE/E0k35azU4jU/s320/home.png" alt=""></a>

<p>The dialer allows to search for contacts in a way similar to the HTC Sense&#39;s
dialer, for example, by pressing &quot;3, 2, 8&quot; it will show me contacts that have
&quot;DAV, EAT, ...&quot; in their names:</p>

</center>

<p>The lock screen has three unlock options: unlock, open dialer and open messaging
app, and when you receive a call you have an option to reject it and send and
SMS (directly from the lock screen):</p>

<p>In addition to the notifications in the notifications bar there are also
&quot;Toggles&quot;, this are toggle buttons that allow to turn various features on and
off (Wifi, Data, GPS, ...). A useful extra feature is that a long press on one
of the toggles open the settings page relevant to that toggle:</p>

<p>The built-in music player reminds me a lot of the iPhone/iPod Touch player:</p>

<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nReLBiXlwAw/Tjv7Uw2ZLaI/AAAAAAAABLc/7AUhD1gQlHU/s1600/music2.png"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nReLBiXlwAw/Tjv7Uw2ZLaI/AAAAAAAABLc/7AUhD1gQlHU/s320/music2.png" alt=""></a>
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qfSaE27QEZw/Tjv7W3eCeTI/AAAAAAAABLg/iIHXtKQJ6MI/s1600/music.png"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qfSaE27QEZw/Tjv7W3eCeTI/AAAAAAAABLg/iIHXtKQJ6MI/s320/music.png" alt=""></a>
</center>

<p>It also comes with a built-in traffic monitor for Wifi/Data/Calls usage:</p>
<center>
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X7DHNAiGoB8/Tjv74NAAPYI/AAAAAAAABLk/pa7nEi1LW_E/s1600/traffic.png"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X7DHNAiGoB8/Tjv74NAAPYI/AAAAAAAABLk/pa7nEi1LW_E/s320/traffic.png" alt=""></a>
</center>

<p>It also comes with a File Explorer, an FTP server, a notes application, and a
clock that can set alarms that use songs from your music library as alarm sounds
(CyanogenMod&#39;s alarm doesn&#39;t allow you to use songs from the music library).</p>
<p>The only thing that bugs me a little is that the camera&#39;s flash doesn&#39;t seem to
work, but since I don&#39;t use the camera that much it (the Desire&#39;s camera is of
low quality) it doesn&#39;t bother me that much.</p>
<p>One of the installation guides I used to install MIUI recommended to install the
5.14.05.17 baseband version, and since then there were no disconnections and
Cellular and GPS reception has improved.</p>
<p>Also, there is a fully Hebrew translation package at <a href="http://hebmiui.com/">http://hebmiui.com/</a></p>
<p>To sum things up, MIUI seems to be very stable, very quick, normal battery usage
and very comfortable UI and I&#39;m having a far better experience than the previous
ROMs I have tried.</p>
<p>So thank you MIUI developers, wherever you are and well done on a great job!</p>
