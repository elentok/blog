hours to Halong Bay (during which talked to a nice Englishman who told us about
his trip to China).</p>
<p>When we got to Halong Bay we went on a four hour cruise to Cat-Ba island (I was
asleep for about three of them due to the motion sickness pill), the view is
absolutely amazing, thousands of giant mountains.</p>
<p>After the cruise we reached the hotel, where we tried to do our laundry by
ourself (the hotel wanted around 30$ for it). Since it was so darn moist,
everything stayed wet and we had to use a hair drier to dry them.</p>

cloud, it was quite extraordinary.</p>
<p>This morning we woke up to the sounds of rain, and since the plan was to walk
through some of the villages, we postponed it and slept for a few more hours
until the weather got better.</p>
<p>After lunch we trekked to see the Lao-Chai and Ta-Van village, very beautiful
places. We met some of the local people (Black H&#39;Mong, Dzay, etc..).</p>

which showed us videos of a cambodian wedding (the husband&#39;s sister).</p>
<p>We managed to get some sleep and woke up to see an amazing view, green trees and
mountains as far as the eyes can see.</p>
<p>We were picked up at the train station, and after eating breakfast we went to
the Bac-Ha market, the drive there was extremely curved and annoying.</p>

At first
there were supposed to be 16 people in the tour, but in the end we were only
four.</p>
<p>Our guide for the day, ngoc, picked us up at the hotel and we began driving to
Tam-Coc. It was about 2 hours of very bumpy roads (I&#39;ve noticed they really like
to honk around here). We made a short stop to see the temple of the first king
of Vietnam.</p>

disappeared.</p>
<p>For about a week, we&#39;ve been looking everywhere for her, and there was no sign
of her. Yesterday, after accepting the fact that she&#39;s probably never going to
come back, my folks decided to adopt another cat.</p>
<p>This morning, she came back...</p>
